# Fundamental Programming Structures in Java

-
-
## A Simple Java Program

```
public class FirstSample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("We will not use 'Hello, World!'"); }
}
```

-

- Java is case sensitive
- Class names must begin with a letter, and after that, they can have any combination of letters and digits
- You cannot use a Java reserved word
- You need to make the name for the source code the same as the name of the public class
- Whitespace is irrelevant to the Java compiler

-

```
public class ClassName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        program statements
    }
}
```

-

- A Class defines all of the Java code
- In Java (pretty much) everything is an Object
- `main` is merely a special method (a function defined in a class) that is executed when a program runs
- `main` doesn't return anything, thus the `void` return keyword
- `main` doesn't operate on an object, thus the `static` keyword

-
##Object Stuff

Since almost everything in Java is an object, for now remember that:
- Static methods are not called on objects themselves
  - `SomeObject.someMethod()`
- Instance methods are called on instances of the objects directly
  ```java
  SomeObject so = new SomeObject();
  so.someInstanceMethod();
  ```
Note the construction of `so`
-
-

##Java Environment
- Code is compiled with `javac`
  - `javac Example.java`
- Code is compiled to a thing called bytecode and saved in class files
- The bytecode is then run in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
  - This means that bytecode can be run on any machine that has the JVM
  - `java Example`

-
-
##Comments

Java has three ways of marking comments:

1. `//` for single line comment
2. ` /*` and `*/` for multiline comments
3. using a `/**` to start and a `*/` to end will be used to generate documentation automatically

-

```
/**
 * This is the first sample program in Core Java Chapter 3
 * @version 1.01 1997-03-22
 * @author Gary Cornell
 */
public class FirstSample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("We will not use 'Hello, World!'");
    }
}
```
<sub>CAUTION: `/* */` comments do not nest in Java.</sub>

##Data Types

Java is a strongly typed language and every variable must have a declared type.

-

There are eight primitive types in Java:

1. int
2. short
3. long
4. byte
5. float
6. double
7. char
8. boolean

-

###Integer Types

The integer types are for numbers without fractional parts.

| Type  | Storage requirments | Range (Inclusive)                                       |
| ----- |:------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| int   | 4 bytes             | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483, 647 (just over 2 billion)  |
| short | 2 bytes             | -32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| long  | 8 bytes             | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| byte  | 1 byte              | -128 to 127                                             |

-

###Floating-Point Types

The floating-point types denote numbers with fractional parts

| Type   | Storage requirments | Range (Inclusive)                                              |
| ------ |:------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| float  | 4 bytes             | Approximately +/-3.40282347E+38F (6â€“7 significant decimal digits) |
| double | 8 bytes             | Approximately +/-1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits)|

-

Due to repeating decimals and the amount of significant digits in floating point types<br/>
you can get incorrect values due to roundoff error.  For example, `2.0 - 1.1` does not return `0.9`.
It returns `0.8999999999999999`
-

###The char Type

Literal values of type char are enclosed in single quotes.

Values of type char can be expressed as hexadecimal values that run from \u0000 to \uFFFF

-

| Escape sequence | Name            | Unicode Value |
| --------------- |:----------------| :------------ |
| \b              | Backspace       | \u0008        |
| \t              | Tab             | \u0009        |
| \n              | Linefeed        | \u000a        |
| \r              | Carriage return | \u000d        |
| \\"              | Double quote    | \u0022        |
| \'              | Single quote    | \u0027        |
| \\\              | Backslash       | \u005c        |

-

###The boolean Type

The boolean type has two values, false and true.

-
##Big Numbers

If the precision of the basic integer and floating-point types is not sufficient, you can turn to a couple of handy classes in the java.math package: BigInteger and BigDecimal.

```
BigInteger a = BigInteger.valueOf(100);
```

-

you cannot use the familiar mathematical operators such as + and * to combine big numbers

```
BigInteger c = a.add(b); // c = a + b
BigInteger d = c.multiply(b.add(BigInteger.valueOf(2))); // d = c * (b + 2)
```

-
-

##Variables

In Java, every variable has a type. You declare a variable by placing the type first, followed by the name of the variable.

```
double salary;
int vacationDays;
long earthPopulation;
boolean done;
```
The semicolon is necessary because a declaration is a complete Java statement.

-


You can declare multiple variables on a single line:

```
int i, j; // both are integers
```

-

###Initializing Variables

After you declare a variable, you must explicitly initialize it by means of an assignment statement you can never use the value of an uninitialized variable.

```
int vacationDays;
System.out.println(vacationDays); // ERROR--variable not initialized
```

-

```
int vacationDays;
vacationDays = 12;
```

-


You can both declare and initialize a variable on the same line. For example:

```
int vacationDays = 12;
```

-

###Constants

The keyword final indicates that you can assign to the variable once, and then its
value is set once and for all. Also known as a constant.

```
public class Constants {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
        double paperWidth = 8.5;
        double paperHeight = 11;
				System.out.println("Paper size in centimeters: "
          + paperWidth * CM_PER_INCH + " by " + paperHeight * CM_PER_INCH);
    }
}
```

-


It is probably more common in Java to create a constant so it's available to multiple methods inside a single class. These are usually called class constants.

```
public class Constants2 {
    public static final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double paperWidth = 8.5;
        double paperHeight = 11; System.out.println("Paper size in centimeters: "
            + paperWidth * CM_PER_INCH + " by " + paperHeight * CM_PER_INCH);
    }
}
```
-

##Operators

The usual arithmetic operators

| Operators       | Arithmetic     |
| --------------- |:---------------|
| +               | Addition       |
| -               | Subtraction    |
| *               | Multiplication |
| /               | Division       |
| %               | Modulus        |


The / operator denotes integer division if both arguments are integers, and floating point division otherwise.

-

###Mathematical Functions and Constants

The Math class contains an assortment of mathematical functions that you may occasionally need

```
double x = 4;
double y = Math.sqrt(x);
System.out.println(y); // prints 2.0

double y = Math.pow(x, a);
```

-

The Math class supplies the usual trigonometric functions:

- Math.sin
- Math.cos
- Math.tan
- Math.atan
- Math.atan2

-

###Conversions between Numeric Types

19 specific conversions on primitive types are called the widening primitive conversions:

- byte to short, int, long, float, or double
- short to int, long, float, or double
- char to int, long, float, or double
- int to long, float, or double
- long to float or double
- float to double

-

A widening primitive conversion does not lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value.

```
int n = 123456789;
float f = n; // f is 1.23456792E8
```

-

###Casts

When two values are combined with a binary operator (such as n + f where n is an integer and f is a floating-point value), both operands are converted to a common type before the operation is carried out.

- If either of the operands is of type double, the other one will be converted to a double.
- Otherwise, if either of the operands is of type float, the other one will be converted to a float.
- Otherwise, if either of the operands is of type long, the other one will be converted to a long.
- Otherwise, both operands will be converted to an int.

-

Conversions in which loss of information is possible are done by means of casts.

```
double x = 9.997;
int nx = (int) x;
```

```
double x = 9.997;
int nx = (int) Math.round(x);
```

-

###Combining Assignment with Operators

`x+=4;` is equivalent to `x=x+4;`

-

###Increment and Decrement Operators

n++ adds 1 to the current value of the variable n, and n-- subtracts 1 from it

```
int n = 12; n++;
```

-

```
int m = 7;
int n = 7;

int a = 2 * ++m; // now a is 16, m is 8
int b = 2 * n++; // now b is 14, n is 8
```

-

###Relational and boolean Operators

To test for equality, use a
double equal sign, ==.

```
3==7 // is false.
```
Use a != for inequality.

```
3!=7 // is true.
```

-

| boolean Operators |                       |
| ----------------- |:--------------------- |
| <                 | Less than             |
| >                 | Greater than          |
| <=                | Less than or equal    |
| >=                | Greater than or equal |

-

Java uses && for the logical "and" operator and || for the logical "or" operator.

The exclamation point ! is the logical negation operator.

-

The && and || operators are evaluated in "short circuit" fashion

The second argument is not evaluated if the first argument already determines the value

`expression1 && expression2`

`x != 0 && 1 / x > x + y //no division by 0`

-

The value of expression1 || expression2 is automatically true if the  first
expression is true, without evaluating the second expression.

-

Java supports the ternary ?: operator

`condition ? expression1 : expression2`

-

```
x < y ? x : y //gives the smaller of x and y
```

-

###Bitwise Operators

& ("and") | ("or") ^ ("xor") ~ ("not")

\>> and << operators which shift a bit pattern to the right or left.

\>>> operator fills the top bits with zero, unlike >> which extends the sign
bit into the top bits. There is no <<< operator.

-

###Parentheses and Operator Hierarchy

[Java order of operations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html)

`a && b || c`

 means

`(a && b) || c`

Since += associates right to left, the expression

`a += b += c`

means

`a += (b += c)`

-

###Enumerated Types

You can define your own enumerated type

`enum Size { SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRA_LARGE };`

Now you can declare variables of this type:

`Size s = Size.MEDIUM;`

-
-

##Strings

Java does not have a built-in string type. Instead, the standard Java library contains a predefined class called String.

```
String e = ""; // an empty string
String greeting = "Hello";
```

-

###Substrings

You can extract a substring from a larger string with the substring method of the String class.

```
String greeting = "Hello";
String s = greeting.substring(0, 3);
```

The second parameter of substring is the first position that you do not want to copy.

-

###Concatenation

Use + to join (concatenate) two strings.

```
String expletive = "Expletive"; String PG13 = "deleted";
String message = expletive + PG13;
```

-

When you concatenate a string with a value that is not a string, the latter is converted to a string.

```
int age = 13;
String rating = "PG" + age;
```

-

```
String all = String.join(" / ", "S", "M", "L", "XL"); // all is the string "S / M / L / XL"
```

-

###Strings Are Immutable

The String class gives no methods that let you change a character in an existing string.

```
greeting = greeting.substring(0, 3) + "p!";
```

Since you cannot change the individual characters in a Java string, the documentation refers to the objects of the String class as immutable.

-

###Testing Strings for Equality

To test whether two strings are equal, use the equals method.

```
s.equals(t)

"Hello".equals(greeting)

"Hello".equalsIgnoreCase("hello")
```

Do not use the == operator to test whether two strings are equal

-

###Empty and Null Strings

The empty string "" is a string of length 0.

`if (str.length() == 0)`

or

`if (str.equals(""))`

-

However, a String variable can also hold a special value, called null

```
if (str == null)

if (str != null && str.length() != 0)
```

###Building Strings

Using the StringBuilder class allows you to build a string from many small pieces.

```
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();

builder.append(ch); // appends a single character
builder.append(str); // appends a string

String completedString = builder.toString();
```
